This work aims at analyzing the use of emotions in political speeches from European Parliament. Specifically, the task involves the fine-tuning of a pre-trained model RoBERTa from hugging face on an emotional dataset GoEmotions to classify emotions and the evaluation of model's performance using common metrics, including precision, recall and F1-score. 

to classify emotions in the speeches. And then i evaluated the modelâ€™s performance using common metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and the F1-score. I investigated how emotions are distributed across different political parties and historical periods. Finally, i applied explainability techniques, specifically SHAP, to understand why the model made certain predictions and to better understand which words contributed the most to the emotional classification.
